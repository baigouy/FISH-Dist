I have a Python function or class method. I want you to generate a Google-style docstring for it. Follow these rules strictly:
Description: Start with a clear one-line description of what the function does.
Args: Include all parameters with their type, description, and default value if any.
Returns: Include return type and description. If the function returns nothing, use None.
Example:
    Always use a fenced code block with ```python.
    If the function returns a value, show a working interactive example with >>> and the expected output.
    If the function returns nothing (None), show usage of the function in a code block without >>>, just demonstrating how to call it.
    Leave two blank lines before the closing triple backticks.
    Indent the code block properly under Example: so it renders correctly in MkDocs.
Keep the rest of the function code unchanged.
Output only the function code with the new docstring, no explanations or extra text.

Here is the function:
